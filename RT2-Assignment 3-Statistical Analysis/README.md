## Assignment 3-Statistical Analysis

Assignment 3 aims to validate a hypothesis using statistical analysis. Specifically, it aims to determine the optimal algorithm for solving a given problem when multiple algorithms are proposed. The analysis involves designing a test scenario and collecting sample data to calculate the mean and variance of the parameter of interest. Statistical tests are then conducted using the collected data to express an opinion on the optimality of the algorithms.
