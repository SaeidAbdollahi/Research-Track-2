## Assignment 2-Jupyter-ROS Interface

The main objective of Assignment 2 is to utilize the capabilities of Jupyter notebook and develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that incorporates interactive widgets, including buttons, text fields, and controls, for seamless interaction with ROS-written software. This GUI will replace the traditional terminal-based interface, offering a more user-friendly approach to ROS interaction. Moreover, by extracting data from ROS and visualizing it on graphs, it becomes possible to effectively monitor the robots' parameters.
