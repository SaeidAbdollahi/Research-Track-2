# Research Track 2-Assignments (1,2,3)

The assignments of Research Track 2 have been solved and their solutions have been compiled in this repository.

## Assignment 1-Software Documentation

The objective of Assignment 1 is to offer a practical understanding of document writing by leveraging popular tools such as Doxygen and Sphinx. This exercise aims to convert the traditional method of text-based commenting in codes into a professional-looking template in HTML format.

## Assignment 2-Jupyter-ROS Interface

The main objective of Assignment 2 is to utilize the capabilities of Jupyter notebook and develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that incorporates interactive widgets, including buttons, text fields, and controls, for seamless interaction with ROS-written software. This GUI will replace the traditional terminal-based interface, offering a more user-friendly approach to ROS interaction. Moreover, by extracting data from ROS and visualizing it on graphs, it becomes possible to effectively monitor the robots' parameters.

## Assignment 3-Statistical Analysis

Assignment 3 aims to validate a hypothesis using statistical analysis. Specifically, it aims to determine the optimal algorithm for solving a given problem when multiple algorithms are proposed. The analysis involves designing a test scenario and collecting sample data to calculate the mean and variance of the parameter of interest. Statistical tests are then conducted using the collected data to express an opinion on the optimality of the algorithms.
